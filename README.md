# Data Cleaning Challenge
I participated in a data cleaning challenge hosted by @PromiseNonso_. The challenge involved cleaning a dataset from the game FIFA 21 using your favourtie tool, I used python with Jupyter Notebook. It helps me testing my code and documenting the entire process.

### Dataset
The dataset used for this challenge was sourced from the game FIFA 21. It contained a variety of information about players such as their age, nationality, club, and player ratings.

### Cleaning Process
To clean the dataset, I followed a step-by-step process documented in a Jupyter Notebook. The cleaning process involved removing duplicates, handling missing values, renaming columns, and converting data types where necessary. The final cleaned dataset was saved in a CSV file.

### Future Use
The cleaned dataset can be used for further analysis and insights. It can help in understanding the trends in player attributes, club-wise player analysis, and predicting player ratings.

### Acknowledgments
I would like to thank @PromiseNonso_ for hosting this data cleaning challenge. It was a great learning experience and helped me improve my data cleaning skills.
